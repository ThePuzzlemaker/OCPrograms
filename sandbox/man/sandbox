NAME
  sandbox - a simple sandbox to run OSes without the need to restart

SYNOPSIS
  sandbox <path>

DESCRIPTION
  This program allows running an OS in a simple sandbox without needing to restart. As of now, it only loads the OS, but in a future release, it will allow fine control about what filesystems and components are allowed.

OPTIONS
  The only argument is path, which is required.
  It is the path to the OS/Filesystem to run. A BIOS is required at <path>/bios.lua for the sandbox to start.
  

EXAMPLES
  sandbox /
    Sandboxes the currently running OS
	
  sandbox /mnt/<disk>
    Sandboxes the OS on disk <disk>
